### **Banking System (C++)**  
This C++ program implements a **basic banking system** with user authentication. It allows users to **register, log in, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance**. User data, including passwords and balances, is stored in a file for persistence.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure login with stored credentials.  
- **Deposits & Withdrawals**: Ensures valid transactions with balance checks.  
- **Balance Inquiry**: Displays the current balance with two decimal precision.  
- **Data Persistence**: Uses a file (`users.txt`) to store user credentials and account balances.  

This project is a **great example of C++ programming**, demonstrating **file handling and basic banking functionalities**. ðŸš€
